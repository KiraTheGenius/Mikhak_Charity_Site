Hello,

This project is about a site that you can accept volunteering task to help people,

Charities create Task and post in on site and every person can choose from them and try to do that Task.

This project was part of my Internship in Quera and I was working on this as a project that can show my skills about Backend, Django and Rest framework at the end we connect frontend to the backend to see final result.
